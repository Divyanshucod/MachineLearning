It is use to solve binary classification problems : if we have output that have only two categories like Ex-> pass/fail
true/false then it is called a binary classification problem.
can we solve these kind of problems using linear regression? so yes. but we have some problem the problem is if we add outliers
the whole best fit line will be change and then for same input it will give wrong output.

Why not use linear regression for binary classification
1. best fit line chnage because of outliers
2. >1 and < 0 value that can only be handle by {squashing}
